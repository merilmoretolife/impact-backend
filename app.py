def generate_impact_analysis(department_input, change_description, product_name):
    prompt = f"""
You are a regulatory and quality expert helping assess the departmental impact of a change in a medical device company.

A user has described a change below. Based on that input, return department-wise impact analysis.

ðŸ“‚ Use the following official master list of documents to choose the correct impacted document numbers with names:
=== MASTER DOCUMENT LIST ===
{doc_masterlist_text}
=== END MASTER LIST ===

The product affected is: **{product_name}**. Use this to determine which section (AB or C) the impacted documents belong to.
- Devices in section C include: Staplers, Trocars (EMD), IUDs, and SFE (Bulk Sutures)
- Use C-section document codes (like `UTSOPC`, `MICSTPC`, etc.) only when the product falls under these categories.

The department stated by the user is: **{department_input}**. However, you must still assess and show impact for **all 5 departments** (Design, Production, QC, QA, RA), even if only one is mentioned.
Use the stated department as an additional clue for likely impacted areas.

For each department that is relevant, generate a table with these columns:
1. Possible Impact Area (row title)
2. Impact â†’ Yes or No
3. Documents Impacted â†’ Use actual document number and names from the list above if impacted, else write "â€”"
4. Justification â†’ Short reason why the document is impacted, or "Not impacted"

Use this layout:
Department: [Department Name]
| Possible Impact Area | Impact | Documents Impacted | Justification |
|----------------------|--------|---------------------|---------------|
| ...                  | ...    | ...                 | ...           |

The departments and their possible impact areas are:

### DESIGN
- Device design, dimensions and specification
- Assembly of Components
- Change in product Safety & Performance - Verification, validation, Clinical
- Packaging Type & Sterilization Method
- Raw Material, Packaging material or Components
- If Other, Please Specify

### PRODUCTION
- Manufacturing Processes - Flow chart, DHR, SOPs
- Machines and equipment
- Process Validation (IQ, OQ, PQ)
- Production planning/Logistics
- Environmental and Premises
- If Other, Please Specify

### QC
- Equipment and Instruments
- Technical Specifications
- Standard Testing Procedures
- Sampling Plan
- Quality Plan
- If Other, Please Specify

### QA
- QMS (e.g., equipment list, VMP)
- Finished Device Specifications & DMR
- Shelf Life
- Suppliers and Sub-contractors/Quality Agreements/Audits
- If Other, Please Specify

### RA
- Technical Documentation / Regulatory Files
- Indications / Intended Use / PMS / Clinical
- Labeling / Artwork
- Notification to NBs / Competent Authorities
- If Other, Please Specify

Always include all 5 departments (Design, Production, QC, QA, RA), even if they are not impacted. If not impacted, clearly write "No" in the Impact column, and "Not applicable" or "No impact" in the justification column.
