def generate_impact_analysis(change_description):
    prompt = f"""
You are a regulatory and quality expert helping assess the departmental impact of a change in a medical device company.

A user has described a change below. Based on that input, return department-wise impact analysis.

For each department that is relevant, generate a table with these columns:
1. Possible Impact Area (row title)
2. Impact â†’ Yes or No
3. Documents Impacted â†’ Use actual document names from the list below if impacted, else write "â€”"
4. Justification â†’ Short reason why the document is impacted, or "Not impacted"

ðŸ“‚ List of documents you MUST use when relevant:
- PRSOP, PFC, STSOP, SCSOP, UTSOP, RMTS, FGTS, PMTS, QCSOP, QCSTP, MICSOP, MICSTP
- PROC (QMS Quality procedures), SMF (Site Master File - DCGI), QMM (Quality Manual)
- RA docs: RA-1 to RA-11
- SC (Supplier Controls), ASL (Approved Supplier List), 
- Validation - IQ, OQ, PQ, VMP
- CAL (Calibration IQ), Calibration Matrix
- Artwork (Labels, IFUs), AHU
- Product Master, Device Master Record, Environmental Monitoring Records, UDI
- Stability Study Plan and Reports
- Technical Master File

Use this layout:
Department: [Department Name]
| Possible Impact Area | Impact | Documents Impacted | Justification |
|----------------------|--------|---------------------|---------------|
| ...                  | ...    | ...                 | ...           |

The departments and their possible impact areas are:

### DESIGN
- Device design, dimensions and specification
- Assembly of Components
- Change in product Safety & Performance - Verification, validation, Clinical
- Packaging Type & Sterilization Method
- Raw Material, Packaging material or Components
- If Other, Please Specify

### PRODUCTION
- Manufacturing Processes - Flow chart, DHR, SOPs
- Machines and equipment
- Process Validation (IQ, OQ, PQ)
- Production planning/Logistics
- Environmental and Premises
- If Other, Please Specify

### QC
- Equipment and Instruments
- Technical Specifications
- Standard Testing Procedures
- Sampling Plan
- Quality Plan
- If Other, Please Specify

### QA
- QMS (e.g., equipment list, VMP)
- Finished Device Specifications & DMR
- Shelf Life
- Suppliers and Sub-contractors/Quality Agreements/Audits
- If Other, Please Specify

### RA

- Indications / Intended Use / PMS / Clinical
- Labeling / Artwork
- Notification to NBs / Competent Authorities

Always include all 5 departments (Design, Production, QC, QA, RA), even if they are not impacted. If not impacted, clearly write "No" in the Impact column, and "Not applicable" or "No impact" in the justification column.
